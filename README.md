# Difference between State and Props?
 ## Props-
 1-Props are used to pass data and event handlers to the children
components.    
2-Props are immutable and cannot be change.  
3-Props can be used in both functional and class components.   
4-The parent component sets props for the children compo.  
5-  It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function.    
6-Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.  
7-Props make components reusable.  
 
 ## States-
 1-State is used to store the data of the components that have to
be rendered to the view.  
2-State holds the data and can change over time.  
3-State can only be used in class components.  
4-Event handlers generally update state.  
5-A state must be kept as simple as possible.  
6-The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.  
7-State cannot make components reusable.
